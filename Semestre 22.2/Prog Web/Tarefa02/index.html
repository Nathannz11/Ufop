                Sinópse: The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. 
                He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present 
                at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is 
                kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival 
                wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's 
                fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war 
                against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.
