abstract = {Teaching basic algorithmic concepts to novices is not an easy task. Existing research has given considerable information about students’ alternative conceptions and faulty mental models about abstract programming concepts and constructs, as well as their difficulties in solving programming problems. Various algorithm visualization systems are proposed as alternative and efficient instructional environments for introductory programming courses. They include dynamic features, based on animation techniques, aiming at illustrating the behavior of basic algorithms and fostering students’ experimentation and algorithmic knowledge construction. This paper presents DAVE, a web-based dynamic algorithm visualization environment designed to support secondary education students’ learning about basic algorithms. DAVE facilitates students’ experimentation with array algorithms by allowing the modification of both code and data. The presentation of preliminary results, obtained from an evaluation study, provided evidence of the usability of the system and its potential to support students’ development of efficient mental models regarding basic array algorithms.}
